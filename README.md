# Multi-Agent AI Knowledge OS

---

## Problem Statement

Students and developers in India face fragmented learning resources, language barriers, and a lack of personalized guidance when studying complex technical subjects. Existing platforms are reactive, single-purpose, and fail to adapt to individual learning patterns.

---

## Solution

Bharat Multi-Agent AI Knowledge OS is an AI-powered learning platform that uses multiple collaborating agents, document-grounded reasoning, and persistent memory to deliver structured, personalized, and multilingual learning support.

---

## Key Features

- Multi-agent AI collaboration  
- Document-based learning using RAG  
- Personalized learning roadmaps  
- Beginner-friendly code debugging  
- Persistent user memory  
- Multilingual support  
- Serverless and cost-efficient architecture  

---

## System Architecture

The platform is built on a layered, serverless AWS architecture:

- Frontend: React / Next.js  
- Backend: AWS Lambda  
- API Layer: Amazon API Gateway  
- AI Layer: Amazon Bedrock  
- Storage: Amazon S3  
- Memory: Amazon DynamoDB  
- Retrieval: Vector embeddings and semantic search  

---

## How It Works

1. User uploads PDFs or submits a query  
2. Backend orchestrates multi-agent workflows  
3. Relevant documents are retrieved using RAG  
4. AI agents collaborate to generate responses  
5. User memory is updated for personalization  
6. Final response is returned to the user

## Security and Privacy

- User-isolated data storage  
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit  
- No sharing of user documents  
- Secure, stateless API design  

---

## MVP Scope

The MVP focuses on:
- Two to three collaborating AI agents  
- Functional RAG pipeline  
- Persistent user memory  
- Clean web dashboard  

---
